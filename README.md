# Web-Scraper
The primary goal of this project is to develop a versatile Python-based web scraper that extracts tabular data from websites, performs fundamental data cleaning and analysis operations, and offers an interactive user interface.
The project aims to serve as a foundation for future enhancements, including the addition of more advanced cleaning and analytical operations and a transition from the command-line interface (CLI) to a graphical user interface (GUI).

Python Libraries Used: 
`requests` for making HTTP requests. 
`BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing. 
`pandas` for data manipulation and analysis. 
`matplotlib` for data visualization. 
Install These Libraries Before Running The Project.
